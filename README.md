Hello! I'm Jakub, a second student at Poznan University of Science and technology. My IT journey started a few years ago in IT technician school where I learned the basics of networks, operating systems and programming.
Currently, I am expanding my knowledge as a student.

In most of my projects on this account, I use the python language along with libraries for scrapping, data processing and GUI for applications.
There are also projects related to the university and the student club GHOST, to which I belong.

I have recently started my journey with exploring the world of DevOps, CD/CI, security and pentesting. I believe that understanding and knowledge are the key to developing reliable, fast and high availability IT sytsems. 

In the near future I would like to explore Azure, AWS oraz GCP solutions and learn Ansible. 

When I'm not immersed in IT, I'm following sport events, riding motocross and watching movies.
